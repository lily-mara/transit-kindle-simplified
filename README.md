# Transit Kindle Driver Server (simplified)

This repo holds the final code example from [my blog
post](https://lilymara.xyz/posts/2024-transit-kindle/) about my transit display
Kindle. This project is a simplified version of the code in my actual
[transit-kindle](https://github.com/lily-mara/transit-kindle) project, which has
much nicer rendering and some better caching features.
